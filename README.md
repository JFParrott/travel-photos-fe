# JFP Travels

## About

A React web application that showcases photographs from my travels. It interacts with a RESTful API which uses a PostgreSQL database. Built using create-react-app, React hooks, react-lazy-load-image-component and Reach Router.

Built as a personal project in order to demonstrate my passions: software development, travel and photography.
